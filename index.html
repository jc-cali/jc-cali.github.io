          <p class="left-align light">Here's a little about myself.  I've been a developer in the IT industry with 20+ years of work experience.  I've started programming in COBOL, survived the Y2K fiasco, and continued to pick up new technologies along the way.  After working 10+ years in the Oracle database environment, I came across an immersive program through General Assembly to learn Android programming.  It was an intense 12 week program and lots of hair pulling (or what was left on my head).  I came out with an appreciation of what it takes to research and develop apps in the Android environment.  I was able to use my wealth of knowledge in the IT industry to guide me along as I learned to program in Java.  Using my previous IT work experience as a blueprint, I've been able to focus on the nuances of writing computer code to help me along through the program.  I see my future with Android as a continous journey, learning new things and applying them to develop products that can benefit myself and others as well.

          <h4>General Assembly</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">General Assembly's Android Development Immersive Program provided me the foundation of Android development.  I was taught Java and how to use the Android SDK.  The apps were developed using Android Studio, where I was taught XML and guidelines for Google's Material Design.  I was exposed to Agile Methodology and development sprints.  Versioning control was performed using GitHub and Git.  I also had the opportunity to work with 3rd party APIs and services.  Below are 2 of the projects I worked on during my time at General Assembly.</p>

            <p class="light">During the duration of the program, I stayed at a friend's place in Chicago's Chinatown area.  Growing up as a child I remember fondly the chinese pastries of my youth.  Unfortunately, technology has not caught up with the bakeries of the small-business owners of Chinatown.  I decided to create an e-commerce app for a bakery as a future scenario of what potential business opportunities lie ahead for them.  I created an Android app using fragments for my tabs.  I also implemented a search bar and filter buttons to search for specific pastries.  The inventory was stored in a SQLite database and Picasso to display the images.</p>

            <img class="waves-effect waves-light" src="app_map.png" />

            <p class="light">On weekends in Chinatown, I've noticed tourists walking up and down the sidewalk without any maps or direction on where to go.  So I decided to create a map of Chinatown (notice a common theme going on?) where I used Google's map API.  I incorporated fragments for the navigation drawer to implement Google's Material design.  I used a SQLite database to store the business information and Picasso to display the images.  I used the OnClickListener off the information windows on the map markers to display fragments for the business' detail activity.</p>
